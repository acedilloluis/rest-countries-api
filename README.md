## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This project used many of the skills I've practiced in previous projects. It was a great way to bring all those skills together in one project. In particular, I used JavaScript's built-in array methods (sort, filter) to search for a country, filter by region, and sort the country's alphabetically.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to work with TailwindCSS. For the dropdown menu I used one designed by TailwindCSS. So, I still have more to learn with Tailwind. 

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS dropdown menu](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/elements/dropdowns) - Provided the base solution for the dropdown menu in the project which I modified slightly
